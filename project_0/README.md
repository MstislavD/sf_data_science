# Project 0. Guess a number

### Description
Guessing a number generated by the computer in minimal possible number of attempts.

### Which case is being solved?
The program should guess a random number in minimal possible number of attempts.

**Rules of competition:**
- Computer generates a number in the range 0 to 100, and we have to guess it. "Guessing" means writing a program that does that.
- Algorithm is informed whether the random number is larger or smaller than his current guess.

**Quality metrics**
Quality of an algorithm is measured by the mean number of attemts after 1000 repetitions.
